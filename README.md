# Student Scores Data Visualization 

## Project Overview

This project reads student scores from a CSV file and visualizes the data using Matplotlib and Pandas. It generates:

- A Pie Chart to display the average scores of different subjects.
- A Bar Chart to compare student scores across subjects.

 ## Files Included

- students_scores.csv – Contains student names and their scores in various subjects.
- DataVisualization.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading, processing, and visualizing the data.


To run this project

- Place the students_scores.csv file in the project directory.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook (DataVisualization.ipynb) or execute the Python script (visualization.py) if using a standalone script.
